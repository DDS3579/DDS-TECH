            Budget gaming is damn hard. Most of the games require high specifications. Most people have a desire to play GTA 5. In fact, I also used to have. For this game to you want a PC for at least 400$. If you have a budget of 400$ then you can easily play GTA 5 and many other popular games. The best PC specs for 400$ is as follows :

            For office works, <strong>200$ to 300$  </strong>would be enough if you have 200$ then, you can go with Intel Core 2 Duo or Intel Core 2 Quad. But if you have more than 200$ then you can go with AMD Ryzen 3 2200g.

            For this purpose, you have to go with a more powerful graphics card. Due to the lack of graphics cards in the market, we are unable to find a good graphics card at a reasonable price. To run photoshop also need at least GTX 1050. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is not possible to use photoshop, illustrator, and software like premiere pro can not run with a PC worth <strong> 200$ to 400$. </strong>
