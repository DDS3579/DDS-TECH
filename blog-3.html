        Hello guys, it's DDS. What's up? Hope you are doing well. Today, I am back with a new trending topic. This is a question for many people who want to upgrade their PC. Hope You guys will like it. I am going to do the comparison between Core i3 7th Generation (i3-7100) and Core i5 7th Generation (i5-7400) (sorry for the picture of i3 10th gen and core i5 10th gen). The information provided in this blog is effective in all generation processors. Now let's get started.

        First of all, if you want to know the difference between Core i3 and Core i5 you need to know the difference between Cores and Threads. This is very important. Soon, I will bring a blog about it. Now, let's talk about the differences.

        These were the differences. Also, you can learn more about these processors on the official Intel website. Let's get back to the topic. If you would ask me then, I would prefer to go with i5 because it contains more cores and threads. Moreover, if you are gaming then the processor has to do a lot of work. It has to instruct the graphic card for the video rendering, sending data to the server, and more. If we talk about normal PC-related works then both are outstanding. On the condition that you want it for video rendering or graphic designing then i5 is the only option. On, i3 you will have to face a lot of lag. I don't think that any one of us likes lag. That's why i5 is better. But here comes the twist i5 is expensive. Most of us have a tight budget. In case of a tight budget, i3 is the only option.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, that's all about the works done by them. It's the conclusion and the time to discuss the main part.

        What is the difference between Cores and Threads ?

     <p class="main-blog-text">
        On the condition that you are reading this blog seriously. Then, you must have noticed then I have been telling you i5 is better because it has more cores and threads. Cores increase the amount of work accomplished at a time, whereas threads improve throughput, computational speed up. The core is an actual hardware component whereas Thread is a virtual component that manages tasks. Threads are to manage the processes.
        <br>
        <br>
        That's it. Hope you would have understood this.
